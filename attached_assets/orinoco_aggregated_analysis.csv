Our server was amazing- gave so many good recommendations and everything we tried was absolutely delicious. The sangria is a must try and the beef and cheese arepa was out of this world. We also tried the chicken and pork arepas, and the chicken and steak plate, and mini ribs. It was so delicious. Our server gave 10/10 service, including bringing us out free dessert and allowed us to sample drinks before ordering. For all that food and drinks for 3 people we only paid $160 after tip.

Orinoco Harvard Square,Venezuelan,Joe Smith,2023-11-14,"My small group had a serendipitous experience at Orinoco. We walked around and happened to stumble on this place for dinner - it's definitely a hidden gem.

I loved the atmosphere; quiet so that I could talk to my group and not too bright or too dark. We ordered the tequenos, plantains, and ribs for appetizers; the latter two were totally delicious. Service was good but nothing spectacular and unfortunately they did not have Arepas that night.

For the main course I got the lamb chops and quinoa. Both were mind-blowingly delicious and cooked to perfection. This was the tastiest quinoa I ever had and a top-tier lamb dish with a delicious mint sauce. The prices were also very reasonable!

Overall highly satisfied with the meal and will definitely come back to try the Arepas.",5.0,135.0,no,no,no,high,o3-mini-2025-01-31

Orinoco Harvard Square,Venezuelan,Oindrilla Chatterjee,2023-11-07,"We recently dined at this quaint spot in Harvard Square. We tried the Steak, the ribs, and the guava flatbread. The guava flatbread was a standout, however, the ribs and the steak didn't quite meet our expectations. The ribs were a bit tough to cut through, and the BBQ sauce, which was the same for both dishes, didn't quite hit the mark for us. We had ordered the steak cooked to medium, but it turned out a bit too chewy and overcooked. The staff kindly replaced it, and the second one came out cooked to a perfect medium, which we appreciated. In terms of beverage options, the selection was somewhat limited, with only wine and beer available. On a less positive note, we did observe a rat scurrying through the dining area, which was quite surprising and definitely detracted from the overall experience.

Edit based on owners question: Appreciate your prompt response. We were seated indoors in the dining room and saw what would be a ‚Äúmouse‚Äù, still pretty disturbing to see it run indoors along the outside wall of the bar
Also yeah, getting a heads up about our order would have been nice. All the 3 items we had ordered had some of the sauce, wish we got a heads up.",2.0,213.0,no,no,no,high,o3-mini-2025-01-31

As other have said, the restaurant was out of arepas when we went. The website is misleading as it talks about prices potentially differing from the website but the tables just have QR codes that take you to another website with pricing that shows everything the restaurant is out of stock. The meat plate was a good value but the steak on it was cooked medium well instead of medium rare. The cachapa wasn‚Äôt super filling. The re at air and was clean and had a nice laid back vibe.

Food was not good. I came from Montreal and there is another Venezuelan restaurant and it's not comparable.

- very small portions. You have to spend around 40$ to be full.
- food is not good for what it seems.
- they make you pay 20% automatically. They just put it on your bill without asking how much or any range.
- long wait time to pay.

I asked why they just add 20% and they told me for 6 persons it's like that unless you are extremely dissatisfied (15% tip) he even told me it's not a law but it's just like that in general. He did not even ask why we were all dissatisfied (all 6 of us).

Orinoco Harvard Square,Venezuelan,Matt Neslusan,2021-10-08,"A fantastic spot for elevated Latin cuisine. They have the typical staples, but also have dishes that go above and beyond. Nice but casual inside, and intimate outdoor seating in the back on a quiet patio that‚Äôs removed from much of the Harvard square street noise. Small but suitable drink options: beer (2 kinds of Latin laggers), wine, and sangria. No hard alcohol, but no big deal. Service is very friendly.

Surprisingly for a Latin place, my biggest recommendation is the baby back ribs. They are hands down the best I‚Äôve had in the Boston area (and I‚Äôm a bbq guy). The sauce is so delicious and complex. Also, the chicken in the Parrilla Caraque√±a was so moist and delicious. My girlfriend and I loved it.

A word of caution - if you sit outside in the back there‚Äôs a chance you may see a furry friend or two. Nothing to be worried about, but a fair warning. No fault of their own, as it‚Äôs a problem in the Cambridge/Somerville/south Medford area.

Our server took our order at 8:50pm, the ticket went in at 9:03pm, and the food came out at 9:45pm. They also forgot one of our sides, but prepared a new one within 10 minutes once the mistake was pointed out. It just wasn't busy enough for the food to take this long and for there to be mistakes.

There was a 20% gratuity automatically added to our check. The wait staff was pretty nice, but they also took time to get to our table, and the food wasn't THAT great where the wait was worth it.

The entrance was a wrought-iron ivy gate, and passing through felt like discovering a secret world. Inside this small restaurant, the decor was thematic, and the cramped seating, though uncomfortable, fit the indie aesthetic.

I ordered the grill plate, which came with steak, chicken, and chorizo for $26. All three meats were good enough, but ""good enough"" doesn't deserve five stars. Especially not with such underwhelming service.

Orinoco has the misfortune of being a good restaurant surrounded by great ones. For hole-in-the-wall charm, I'd go to Pinocchio's Pizza or 9 Tastes Thai, both on the same block and at a lower price point. For great food, I'd go to Park, just across the street.

Orinoco Harvard Square,Venezuelan,George,2019-08-03,"While their name sounds more like a gas station, this is a cool little South American eatery tucked in an alley of Harvard Square. They have a diverse menu of a variety of arepas, empanadas, pepitos (sandwiches), and principales (main dishes). Many of these menu items are very authentic South American dishes that you would be hard-pressed to find in any other restaurant.
I personally would recommend sticking to the pepitos and principales, since I've found to be very wholesome and well thought-out plates. The empanadas are served with a central salad presentation and can be a bit dry and heavy.
For filling a rare culinary niche in Harvard Square, I would score the place 5 stars, but it can be challenging to get seats (no reservations) and their sometimes rather brusque service detracts one star.",4.0,136.0,no,no,no,high,o3-mini-2025-01-31

I loved the atmosphere; quiet so that I could talk to my group and not too bright or too dark. We ordered the tequenos, plantains, and ribs for appetizers; the latter two were totally delicious. Service was good but nothing spectacular and unfortunately they did not have Arepas that night.

For the main course I got the lamb chops and quinoa. Both were mind-blowingly delicious and cooked to perfection. This was the tastiest quinoa I ever had and a top-tier lamb dish with a delicious mint sauce. The prices were also very reasonable!

We had ordered the steak cooked to medium, but it turned out a bit too chewy and overcooked. The staff kindly replaced it, and the second one came out cooked to a perfect medium, which we appreciated. In terms of beverage options, the selection was somewhat limited, with only wine and beer available. On a less positive note, we did observe a rat scurrying through the dining area, which was quite surprising and definitely detracted from the overall experience.

Edit based on owners question: Appreciate your prompt response. We were seated indoors in the dining room and saw what would be a ‚Äúmouse‚Äù, still pretty disturbing to see it run indoors along the outside wall of the bar
Also yeah, getting a heads up about our order would have been nice. All the 3 items we had ordered had some of the sauce, wish we got a heads up.",2.0,213.0,no,no,no,high,gpt-4o-2024-08-06

Food was not good. I came from Montreal and there is another Venezuelan restaurant and it's not comparable.

- food is not good for what it seems.
- they make you pay 20% automatically. They just put it on your bill without asking how much or any range.
- long wait time to pay.

I asked why they just add 20% and they told me for 6 persons it's like that unless you are extremely dissatisfied (15% tip) he even told me it's not a law but it's just like that in general. He did not even ask why we were all dissatisfied (all 6 of us).

The arepas are a little charred on the outside, with tasty fillings and always brought to the next level with a dab of their super garlicky mojo. The yuca frita came out crispy, hot and fresh. The costillitas were fall-off-the-bone tender and glazed in a sweet sticky sauce. I appreciate that the fried plantains still had some bite to it and weren‚Äôt overly ripened or mushy, but still sweet - perfect for the pabell√≥n criollo plate.

The sangria pitcher is totally worth it! It's an incredible blend of wine, fruit, and cinnamon flavors that are out of this world. We also ordered the bacon wrapped dates, and they could score you a second date if you're lucky. Mileage may vary. 5 stars.",5.0,98.0,no,no,no,low,gpt-4o-2024-08-06

Orinoco Harvard Square,Venezuelan,Matt Neslusan,2021-10-08,"A fantastic spot for elevated Latin cuisine. They have the typical staples, but also have dishes that go above and beyond. Nice but casual inside, and intimate outdoor seating in the back on a quiet patio that‚Äôs removed from much of the Harvard square street noise. Small but suitable drink options: beer (2 kinds of Latin laggers), wine, and sangria. No hard alcohol, but no big deal. Service is very friendly.

Surprisingly for a Latin place, my biggest recommendation is the baby back ribs. They are hands down the best I‚Äôve had in the Boston area (and I‚Äôm a bbq guy). The sauce is so delicious and complex. Also, the chicken in the Parrilla Caraque√±a was so moist and delicious. My girlfriend and I loved it.

A word of caution - if you sit outside in the back there‚Äôs a chance you may see a furry friend or two. Nothing to be worried about, but a fair warning. No fault of their own, as it‚Äôs a problem in the Cambridge/Somerville/south Medford area.

Our server took our order at 8:50pm, the ticket went in at 9:03pm, and the food came out at 9:45pm. They also forgot one of our sides, but prepared a new one within 10 minutes once the mistake was pointed out. It just wasn't busy enough for the food to take this long and for there to be mistakes.

There was a 20% gratuity automatically added to our check. The wait staff was pretty nice, but they also took time to get to our table, and the food wasn't THAT great where the wait was worth it.

I ordered the grill plate, which came with steak, chicken, and chorizo for $26. All three meats were good enough, but ""good enough"" doesn't deserve five stars. Especially not with such underwhelming service.

Orinoco has the misfortune of being a good restaurant surrounded by great ones.

Orinoco Harvard Square,Venezuelan,George,2019-08-03,"While their name sounds more like a gas station, this is a cool little South American eatery tucked in an alley of Harvard Square. They have a diverse menu of a variety of arepas, empanadas, pepitos (sandwiches), and principales (main dishes). Many of these menu items are very authentic South American dishes that you would be hard-pressed to find in any other restaurant.
I personally would recommend sticking to the pepitos and principales, since I've found to be very wholesome and well thought-out plates. The empanadas are served with a central salad presentation and can be a bit dry and heavy.
For filling a rare culinary niche in Harvard Square, I would score the place 5 stars, but it can be challenging to get seats (no reservations) and their sometimes rather brusque service detracts one star.",4.0,136.0,no,no,no,low,gpt-4o-2024-08-06

My friend and I also got the fried yuca side ($5.50) to share. For whatever reason, the yuca was cold and stale already by the time it got to our table. The chicken on my salad was tougher than leather. Sweetgreen makes a better salad.

I love this place for affordable, shared plates. The flavors here are amazing and the arepas and empanadas go so well with the mojo.

The parillo caraque√±a is great variety of meats and flavors, plus it comes with fried yuca, which I love.
